<p style='font-size:18px;text-align:justify'>
Examines in detail the software development process. Topics include software life-cycle models; architectural and design
approaches; various techniques for systematic software testing; coding and documentation strategies; project management;
customer relations; the social, ethical, and legal aspects of computing; and the impact of economic, environmental, safety,
manufacturability, and sustainability factors on design. Students in this course participate in a real-world project from
conception to implementation. 
</p>

<p style='font-size:18px;text-align:justify'>
Using a semester-long team-project of the students’ choosing, the class provides a first-hand experience using proper agile
processes. Students must stay up-to-date with both the course and the project and do their best to put these topics into
practice. While many mistakes are expected, the intent is that students appreciate the important of their software engineering
choices and can avoid duplicating these mistakes later in the term and (more important) in their future careers.
</p>

## 3. Textbook and Materials 
<p style='font-size:18px; text-align:justify'>
There is no required textbook for this course. There will be required readings throughout the term and these readings will be a mix of articles by practicing software engineers and descriptions of how to carry these ideas through.  
</p>
<p style='font-size:18px; text-align:justify'>
Readings will be available as links on the course website and should be completed for the lecture in which they are listed.

### 7.2 Grade Policy
There is **No Curve** for this course, the final letter grade is based upon the following cutoffs:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>&ge;93</td>
    <td>&ge;90 && &lt;93 </td>
    <td>&ge;87 && &lt;90 </td>
    <td>&ge;83 && &lt;87 </td>
    <td>&ge;80 && &lt;83 </td>

### 7.3 About Projects
<p style='font-size:18px;text-align:justify'>
Each team will complete their project over a series of 4 sprints. The work in each sprint will be presented and graded during
each group's usual project manager meeting times, mostly during their weekly recitations.
</p>

<p style='font-size:18px;text-align:justify'>
<i><u>*To ensure that credit is earned only by students who participated in its creation, each of the sprint's documents and demos will need to be 
submitted by the students who did the work. Allowing a student who was not in attendance or did not contribute to the document is an academic integrity
policy violation by both the student submitting others' work as their own AND the students who allowed their material
copied.</u></i>
</p>

#### 7.3.1 Grading and Project Manager
<p style='font-size:18px; text-align:justify'>
The Sprint sessions will be led by students from the CSE404 Software Project Management course during recitations (and other additional time slots at students choice). During those presentations, it is the team’s responsibility to demonstrate that they have met each of the criteria from the grading rubric. The project managers will provide feedback on the students' sprint performance, but the end-of-sprint grade will be done by instructors based on the project progress, <b>NOT</b> by the group's project manager.
</p>

<p style='font-size:18px; text-align:justify'>
At the end of each sprint, students will be able to complete a peer- and self-evaluation. These evaluations provide feedback on
how well each team member contributed to the team during that sprint. A similar evaluation will also be completed by the
team's project manager. The instructor reserves the right to manually adjust individual sprint grades within a group if the level
of effort is significantly different across members that has not been accounted for by meeting preparedness adjustments.
</p>

#### 7.3.2 Final Project Presentation (10% of total course grade)
<p style='font-size:18px; text-align:justify'>
Students will present a sales demo of their completed project with content and style that is appropriate for a commercial demo.
These sales demos will need to be <b>7 – 9</b> minutes and take place during the last weeks of lecture and the final exam period. Each team will need to write a project report and repare a pre-recorded video recording of the same demo for submission. A
detailed grading rubric for these presentations will be available on the course website.
</p>

### 7.4 In-class Activities and Assignments (10% of final course grade)
<p style='font-size:18px; text-align:justify'>
Throughout the term, individuals and groups will work on activities and assignments related to the course material. These activities will require
that students reflect on the software engineering concepts presented in lectures/lecture videos before answering questions on
how they think would be the best way that they could bring those concepts into practice. These documents will need to be
saved as a PDF file and submitted via AutoLab. Since these activities and assignment will also be used to assess department-level student
learning outcomes, it is important that all students participate. 
</p>

### 7.5 Deadlines and Late Submission Policy
<p style='font-size:18px; text-align:justify'>
There is no exception to meeting the deadlines (except legitimate medical conditions). For students having known medical conditions, please send emails to the Instructor in the first week of the semester (by mid-night Friday, Feb 2, 2022) or as soon as their official enrollment into this class to arrange approiate accomodations. Beyond the specified deadlines, all students will be treated equally for the deadlines. For emergent medical conditions, the students need to send the Instructor the official medical docotor's note to certify the need for special accommodation - (There are <b>NO</b>) needs for mentioning the medical conditions) - within three-days of missing the deadlines.
