<p style='font-size:18px;text-align:justify'>
Examines in detail the software development process. Topics include software life-cycle models; architectural and design
approaches; various techniques for systematic software testing; coding and documentation strategies; project management;
customer relations; the social, ethical, and legal aspects of computing; and the impact of economic, environmental, safety,
manufacturability, and sustainability factors on design. Students in this course participate in a real-world project from
conception to implementation. 
</p>

<p style='font-size:18px;text-align:justify'>
Using a semester-long team-project of the students’ choosing, the class provides a first-hand experience using proper agile
processes. Students must stay up-to-date with both the course and the project and do their best to put these topics into
practice. While many mistakes are expected, the intent is that students appreciate the important of their software engineering
choices and can avoid duplicating these mistakes later in the term and (more important) in their future careers.

#### 3.2 Grade Policy
There is **No Curve** for this course, the final letter grade is based upon the following cutoffs:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>&ge;93</td>
    <td>&ge;90 && &lt;93 </td>
    <td>&ge;87 && &lt;90 </td>
    <td>&ge;83 && &lt;87 </td>
    <td>&ge;80 && &lt;83 </td>
    <td>&ge;77 && &lt;80 </td>
    <td>&ge;73 && &lt;77 </td>
    <td>&ge;70 && &lt;73 </td>

#### 3.3 About Projects
<p style='font-size:18px;text-align:justify'>
Each team will complete their project over a series of 4 sprints. The work in each sprint will be presented and graded during
each group's usual project manager meeting time.
</p>

<p style='font-size:18px;text-align:justify'>
<i><u>*To ensure that credit is earned only by students who participated in its creation, each of the document's authors will need to
submit this work. Allowing a student who was not in attendance or did not contribute to the document is an academic integrity
policy violation by both the student submitting others' work as their own AND the students who allowed their material be
copied.</u></i>
</p>

###### 3.3.1 Grading and Project Manager
<p style='font-size:18px; text-align:justify'>
The grading sessions will be led by students from the Project Management course. During this presentation, it is the team’s responsibility to demonstrate that they met each of the criteria from the grading rubric. The end-of-sprint grading will <b>NOT</b> be done by the group's project manager. Their project manager will NOT have any input into
the team’s sprint grade.
</p>

<p style='font-size:18px; text-align:justify'>
At the end of the sprint, students will be able to complete a peer- and self-evaluation. These evaluations provide feedback on
how well each team member contributed to the team during that sprint. A similar evaluation will also be completed by the
team's project manager. The instructor reserves the right to manually adjust individual sprint grades within a group if the level
of effort is significantly different across members that has not been accounted for by meeting preparedness adjustments.
</p>

###### 3.3.2 Final Project Presentation (15% of total course grade)
<p style='font-size:18px; text-align:justify'>
Students will present a sales demo of their completed project with content and style that is appropriate for a commercial demo.
These sales demos will need to be <b>7 – 9</b> minutes and take place during the last weeks of lecture and the final exam period. A
detailed grading rubric for these presentations will be available on the course website.
</p>

#### 3.4 Lecture Activities (10% of final course grade)
Throughout the term, individuals and groups will work on activities related to the course material. These activities will require
that students reflect on the software engineering concepts presented in lectures/lecture videos before answering questions on
how they think would be the best way that they could bring those concepts into practice. These documents will need to be
saved as a PDF file and submitted via AutoLab. Since these activities will also be used to assess department-level student
learning outcomes, it is important that all students participate.
