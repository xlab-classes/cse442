<p style='font-size:18px;text-align:justify'>
Examines in detail the software development process. Topics include software life-cycle models; architectural and design
approaches; various techniques for systematic software testing; coding and documentation strategies; project management;
customer relations; the social, ethical, and legal aspects of computing; and the impact of economic, environmental, safety,
manufacturability, and sustainability factors on design. Students in this course participate in a real-world project from
conception to implementation. 
</p>

<p style='font-size:18px;text-align:justify'>
Using a semester-long team-project of the students’ choosing, the class provides a first-hand experience using proper agile
processes. Students must stay up-to-date with both the course and the project and do their best to put these topics into
practice. While many mistakes are expected, the intent is that students appreciate the important of their software engineering
choices and can avoid duplicating these mistakes later in the term and (more important) in their future careers.

## 3. Textbook and Materials 
<p style='font-size:18px; text-align:justify'>
There is no required textbook for this course. There will be required readings throughout the term and these readings will be a mix of articles by practicing software engineers and descriptions of how to carry these ideas through.  
</p>
<p style='font-size:18px; text-align:justify'>
Readings will be available as links on the course website and should be completed for the lecture in which they are listed. 
</p>

## 4. Student Learning Outcome
<p style='font-size:18px; text-align:justify'>
This course serves as a capstone course for the computer science major. It covers all 6 student learning outcomes from the ABET Computer accreditation standards. A mapping of the student learning outcomes and instruments used to assess these outcomes are:
</p>

## 5. Computing Resources
<p style='font-size:18px; text-align:justify'>
You will be provided with a CSE undergraduate computing account. You may use the undergraduate lab facilities in Baldy 19 and Baldy 21. These facilities are available for use as listed on the course website.  They are on card-access - use your UB card to open the door. For your own safety, and to protect the equipment in the lab, do not open or hold the door open in order to allow other people to gain entry to the lab. All students authorized to use the lab have card access. 
</p>

<p style='font-size:18px; text-align:justify'>
As this is an upper-level course, you are expected to be proficient at using the machines in the lab and the Linux operating system. While each team may design a project of their choice, your entire team will need to do whatever learning is required to gain expertise in that environment. A lack of familiarity with your chosen tools is NOT an acceptable excuse for a lack of work. Information about the CSE computing environment can be found at <a href='https://wiki.cse.buffalo.edu/services/'>https://wiki.cse.buffalo.edu/services/</a>
</p>

<p style='font-size:18px; text-align:justify'>
You are expected to use your UB e-mail account for all communications with course staff. Always include an informative subject line for your e-mail.
</p>

<p style='font-size:18px; text-align:justify'>
<b> If your project requires different computing resources, please discuss with the Instructor for approval.</b>
</p>

## 6. Course Requirements

### 6.1 Lectures

<p style='font-size:18px; text-align:justify'>
For all but a few lectures, students will have assigned readings. These readings are listed on the course webpage. Lectures will expand and reinforce material from those readings with an assumption that students have completed it. After the class ends, a recording of the lecture will be posted on Panopto. Any PowerPoint deck presented will also be made available via the course website.
</p>

<p style='font-size:18px; text-align:justify'>
Lectures will present practical applications of these concepts with the expectation that students incorporate this into their project workflow. Additionally, the class will include occasional activities to provide a chance to reflect and review these concepts. It is important that students remain up-to-date with this material and seek additional help whenever they struggle.
</p>

<p style='font-size:18px; text-align:justify'>
Class attendance is mandatory and expected. If you miss a class, you are responsible for talking to your classmate or the instructor to find out what happened. If must miss class for an extended period of time, notify your instructor as soon as possible, and see your instructor immediately upon your return in order to determine how to catch up. If you have missed a significant portion of the semester, it may be recommended that you resign from the course.
</p>

### 6.2 Project Meetings

<p style='font-size:18px; text-align:justify'>
Recitation times will be used for teams to have meet time with their project manager. These meetings duplicate a common industry practice: the daily standup.  Daily standups ensure the entire team remains focused, productive, and cohesive. Issues and concerns are also raised in these meeting, though solutions wait until the meeting ends. 
</p>

<p style='font-size:18px; text-align:justify'>
Weekly project meetings will also provide opportunities for learning and improvement. For most students, this class will be their first time seeing or using common software engineering practices and everyone gets confused and makes mistakes while they learn. With this expectation, students can use this time to get answers to questions they have about best practices. Project managers can also provide constructive feedback on the team’s work and communications.
</p>

<p style='font-size:18px; text-align:justify'>
As in industry, <b>attending these meetings on time and prepared is mandatory.</b>  Arriving between 5 – 15 minutes late will be counted as ½ a skipped meeting; arriving over 15 minutes late is counted as if that meeting were skipped. You can miss or come unprepared to 1 meeting without penalty. At the end of the term, <b>your grade will be decreased 1 step for each additional meeting missed or for which you were unprepared.</b> This means if you earn the points for an A, but missed 2 meetings, your grade would be an A-. If you earn the points for a B, but missed 2 meetings, your grade would be a C+. 
</p>

<p style='font-size:18px; text-align:justify'>
This attendance policy is not intended to be punitive, but to make certain teams make progress at an even, consistent pace through the term. But it is also understood that you might be preparing for life beyond graduation and have other important life events. <b>If you know you will not be able to attend a meeting, tell your group & Project Manager in the previous meeting and check with the instructor that this absence can be excused.</b> If you are <b>too sick to attend that day’s meeting, let your group & Project Manager know (if possible) and provide the instructor with documentation</b> of your illness once you return. 
</p>

### 6.3 Time outside of class

<p style='font-size:18px; text-align:justify'>
Office hours are another chance for you to get individualized answers to your questions about the course. The instructor has scheduled office hours posted on the course website. Office hours are held on a first-come first-served drop-in basis. <b>No appointment is necessary</b>, but be aware that office hours become increasingly busy as deadlines or exams approach. Plan your use of office hours accordingly. Meetings outside of planned office hours are possible, but if you want to meet outside of planned office hours, you will need to talk to the instructor and see if their schedule allows.
</p>

<p style='font-size:18px; text-align:justify'>
New York State Board of Regents regulations specify for every hour of time spent in lecture or recitation, students are expected to spend 2–3 hours on work outside of class. This means that <b>you should expect to spend at least 8 hours each week on readings, meetings, working on your project, and studying.</b>
</p>

### 7.2 Grade Policy
There is **No Curve** for this course, the final letter grade is based upon the following cutoffs:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>&ge;93</td>
    <td>&ge;90 && &lt;93 </td>
    <td>&ge;87 && &lt;90 </td>
    <td>&ge;83 && &lt;87 </td>
    <td>&ge;80 && &lt;83 </td>
    <td>&ge;77 && &lt;80 </td>
    <td>&ge;73 && &lt;77 </td>
    <td>&ge;70 && &lt;73 </td>
    <td>&ge;67 && &lt;70 </td>
    <td>&ge;60 && &lt;67 </td>
    <td>&lt;60  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>A</td>
    <td>A- </td>
    <td>B+ </td>
    <td>B </td>
    <td>B- </td>
    <td>C+ </td>
    <td>C </td>
    <td>C- </td>
    <td>D+ </td>
    <td>D </td>
    <td>F </td>
  </tr>
</table>
If necessary, the instructor may revise these cutoffs downward. 


### 7.3 About Projects
<p style='font-size:18px;text-align:justify'>
Each team will complete their project over a series of 4 sprints. The work in each sprint will be presented and graded during
each group's usual project manager meeting times, mostly during their weekly recitations.
</p>

<p style='font-size:18px;text-align:justify'>
<i><u>*To ensure that credit is earned only by students who participated in its creation, each of the sprint's documents and demos will need to be 
submitted by the students who did the work. Allowing a student who was not in attendance or did not contribute to the document is an academic integrity
policy violation by both the student submitting others' work as their own AND the students who allowed their material
copied.</u></i>
</p>

#### 7.3.1 Grading and Project Manager
<p style='font-size:18px; text-align:justify'>
The Sprint sessions will be led by students from the CSE404 Software Project Management course during recitations (and other additional time slots at students choice). During those presentations, it is the team’s responsibility to demonstrate that they have met each of the criteria from the grading rubric. The project managers will provide feedback on the students' sprint performance, but the end-of-sprint grade will be done by instructors based on the project progress, <b>NOT</b> by the group's project manager.
</p>

<p style='font-size:18px; text-align:justify'>
At the end of each sprint, students will be able to complete a peer- and self-evaluation. These evaluations provide feedback on
how well each team member contributed to the team during that sprint. A similar evaluation will also be completed by the
team's project manager. The instructor reserves the right to manually adjust individual sprint grades within a group if the level
of effort is significantly different across members that has not been accounted for by meeting preparedness adjustments.
</p>

#### 7.3.2 Final Project Presentation (10% of total course grade)
<p style='font-size:18px; text-align:justify'>
Students will present a sales demo of their completed project with content and style that is appropriate for a commercial demo.
These sales demos will need to be <b>7 – 9</b> minutes and take place during the last weeks of lecture and the final exam period. Each team will need to write a project report and repare a pre-recorded video recording of the same demo for submission. A
detailed grading rubric for these presentations will be available on the course website.
</p>

### 7.4 In-class Activities and Assignments (10% of final course grade)
<p style='font-size:18px; text-align:justify'>
Throughout the term, individuals and groups will work on activities and assignments related to the course material. These activities will require
that students reflect on the software engineering concepts presented in lectures/lecture videos before answering questions on
how they think would be the best way that they could bring those concepts into practice. These documents will need to be
saved as a PDF file and submitted via AutoLab. Since these activities and assignment will also be used to assess department-level student
learning outcomes, it is important that all students participate. 
</p>

### 7.5 Deadlines and Late Submission Policy
<p style='font-size:18px; text-align:justify'>
There is no exception to meeting the deadlines (except legitimate medical conditions). For students having known medical conditions, please send emails to the Instructor in the first week of the semester (by mid-night Friday, Feb 2, 2022) or as soon as their official enrollment into this class to arrange approiate accomodations. Beyond the specified deadlines, all students will be treated equally for the deadlines. For emergent medical conditions, the students need to send the Instructor the official medical docotor's note to certify the need for special accommodation - (There are <b>NO</b>) needs for mentioning the medical conditions) - within three-days of missing the deadlines.
</p>

<p style='font-size:18px; text-align:justify'> All grades will be done the following week of each Sprint.
	</p>
	
- Due in the noon on **Feb 12**, team forming. See details below (5%)
- Due in the week of **Feb 21** during your respective recitation for Sprint 1 project progress and demos (15%)
- Due in the week of **March 14** during your respective recitation for Sprint 2 project progress and demos (20%)
- Due in the week of **April 11** during your respective recitation for Sprint 3 project progress and demos (20%)
- Due in the week of **May 2** during your respective recitation for Sprint42 project progress and demos (20%)
- Due in the Final week of **May 9** to present your project presentation and demos to the Instructor (5%)
- Due in the noon on **May 13** for final project report and recorded video demo (5%)

### 7.6 Team forming
<p style='font-size:18px; text-align:justify'>
	Exactly 1 member of your team needs to use <a href="https://classroom.github.com/a/IRQSUdVo">this link</a> to the GitHub classroom to setup your repo.
	After creating your team, there will be a team’s <a href="https://github.com/xlab-classes">private repo</a> at GitHub.
The student creating the team will need to add the other team members to their team project.
</p>

## 8. Incomplete Grades

<p style='font-size:18px; text-align:justify'>
We will follow the UB Undergraduate Catalog Statement on Incomplete Grades, found in the Undergraduate Catalog.  Generally, incomplete (“I”) grades are not given. However, very rarely, circumstances truly beyond a student's control prevents him or her from completing work in the course. In such cases the instructor can give a grade of “I”. The student will be given instructions and a deadline for completing the work, usually no more than 30 days past the end of the semester. University and department policy dictate that “I” grades can be given only if the following conditions are met:
</p>

<ul style='font-size:18px; text-align:justify'>
<li>	An Incomplete will only be given for missing a small part of the course. </li>
<li>	An Incomplete will only be given when the student misses work due to circumstances beyond his/her control. </li>
<li>	An Incomplete will only be given when the student is passing the course except for the missed material. </li>
<li>	An Incomplete is to be made up with the original course instructor within the time specified by the appropriate University regulation (see appropriate document above), and usually within the following semester. </li>
<li>	An Incomplete will not be given to allow the student to informally retake the entire course, and have that grade count as the grade of the original course. </li>
</ul>

<p style='font-size:18px; text-align:justify'>
Incompletes cannot be given as a shelter from poor grades. It is your responsibility to make a timely resignation from the course if you are doing poorly for any reason. The last day to resign the course is Friday, April 16, 2021.
</p>

## 9. Diversity

<p style='font-size:18px; text-align:justify'>
The UB School of Engineering and Applied Sciences considers the diversity of its students, faculty, and staff to be a strength, critical to our success. We are committed to providing a safe space and a culture of mutual respect and inclusiveness for all. We believe a community of faculty, students, and staff who bring diverse life experiences and perspectives leads to a superior working environment, and we welcome differences in race, ethnicity, gender, age, religion, language, intellectual and physical ability, sexual orientation, gender identity, socioeconomic status, and veteran status. 
</p>

## 10. Accessibility Resources 

<p style='font-size:18px; text-align:justify'>
If you have any disability which requires reasonable accommodations to enable you to participate in this course, please contact the Office of Accessibility Resources in 60 Capen Hall, 716-645-2608 and also the instructor of this course during the first week of class. The office will provide you with information and review appropriate arrangements for reasonable accommodations, which can be found on the web at: <a href='http://www.buffalo.edu/studentlife/who-we-are/departments/accessibility.html'>http://www.buffalo.edu/studentlife/who-we-are/departments/accessibility.html</a>.
